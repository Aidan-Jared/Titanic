# Titanic

## Introduction
This is a practice project to work with h2o.ai and scipy.stats on the titanic dataset from kaggle

## Data
The data set gives a list of the passengers on the titanic and wether or not they survived.

## Hypothesis Test
The first question I wanted to ask was if gender played a significant part in suriving the titanic. In order to answer this question I decided to do a Binomial Hypothesis test because in the case of the titanic you either surved or you did not giving two possible results which Binomials are all about.
